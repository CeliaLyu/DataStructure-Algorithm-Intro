## About this material

In short, this material offers intermediate to advanced algorithm content, tailored to enhance the essential knowledge required for an engineer's role. The structure of the material: 
* **Data Structures**: These are the building blocks of our computational systems. Understanding them is vital as they lay the groundwork for more complex programming tasks, offering ways to organize, store, and access data efficiently.
* **Classical algorithms**: Our approach is about more than just understanding algorithms; it's about internalizing their core principles. By diving deep into a range of traditional problems, we build a reference database in our minds, allowing us to quickly draw parallels and solutions when faced with new challenges.

## Rationale behind this material

Navigating the intricacies of data structures and algorithms can be daunting, especially when applying them in real-world engineering tasks. Yet, mastering them is essential for every engineer striving for excellence in their respective field.

At the core of computer science is a fusion of various disciplines. From enumerative combinatorics to linear algebra in computer vision, the essence lies in the application of these principles to solve genuine challenges. What drives progress in this field is not just rote learning, but a genuine passion for understanding and implementing these principles.

While numerous resources delve into algorithmic theories (Introduction to Algorithms, Algorithmic Problem Solving, and so on) or exclusively focus on interview preparation (Cracking the Coding Interview, Coding Interview Questions, etc.), there's a noticeable gap. Few materials bridge the foundational knowledge with its practical, on-the-job application. This material is designed to fill that void. It underscores principles, patterns, and real-world problem-solving, using algorithmic concepts.

It's essential to note that this material does NOT aim to be a shortcut for interview success or offer hiring insights. Instead, it seeks to illuminate the elegance of algorithmic problem-solving. It's about nurturing a deeper appreciation for software engineering, with interview-style questions serving merely as a practical framework to solidify our understanding.
